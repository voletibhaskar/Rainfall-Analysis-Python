The given abstract includes the various algorithms used in the process of determining the better model to satisfy the required condition of a good prediction.

The various applications have been applied such as the following: 
1. Data Manipulation and Analysis 
2. Linear Classifier-Perceptron 
3. Decision Trees-Classifier 
4. Logistic Regression 
5. Linear Regression 
6. MLP-Multi Layer Perceptron 
7. SVM-Support Vector Machine 
8. KNN Model 
9. GMM-EM Model 
 
Data mining or manipulation, involves the use of sophisticated data analysis tools to discover previously unknown, valid patterns and relationships in large data sets. These tools can include statistical models, mathematical algorithms, and machine learning methods which distinguish various patterns and understanding of the given dataset through plots and figures. 
It creates a simple and a clear flow for the understanding and analysis of the rainfall occurring in the given area and its usage for the coming experiments.
